# StarMade Launcher Version 3.0.0
This is the launcher for StarMade. It is a Java application that will download and install StarMade for you. It will also keep StarMade up to date and can be used to switch branches.
It can automatically download and install the correct Java version as well. Game versions below 0.3 use Java 8, while versions 0.3 and above use Java 11.
This launcher was created due to the old one being outdated and only being able ton use Java 8.
